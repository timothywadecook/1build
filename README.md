# About the Project

This site was whipped up using CRA with the Typescript template to get going quickly.

It's not perfect, but it was fun to work on and it's where I could get in the amount of time I allocated.

If I spent more time on this, I would've asked more questions to Chris. I actually got hung up on rendering the drop shadow behind the hero image. I wanted to figure it out because it was a sick looking design, but before burning too much time I decided to keep moving forward and only come back if I had time. Maybe this weekend :).

I also would eventually figure out a consistent approach to managing the CSS. I am generally a fan of inline styling and using flex box becuase it makes it easier to go back and forth with React Native. However, there were a number of things I just threw into the App.css partially to move quickly and partially because I read there may be cross-browser compatibiltiy issues with trying to inline, eg. psuedo classes.

Oh, also I didn't recognize the format of the "posted" timestamp. So moment thinks people were posting "51 years ago" lol.
